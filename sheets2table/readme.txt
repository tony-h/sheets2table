A simple to use plugin that builds an HTML table from a Google Sheet.

== Description ==
Building an HTML table is not rocket science, but keeping the HTML table data up to date is cumbersome and can be time consuming or error prone when making frequent updates. An easier solution is to keep the data in a format and platform that is designed for data entry and collaboration and then dynamically render that data as HTML. Sheets2Table creates a snapshot of a Google Sheet and then dynamically displays the tabular data as an HTML table in WordPress. Using the FooTable plugin, the table is made responsive.

Sheets2Table provides flexibility by allowing a WordPress admin the ability to save a snapshot of the Google Sheet to a user-defined file name. Using the shortcode configuration tool, the admin can display specific columns and rename the column headers.
